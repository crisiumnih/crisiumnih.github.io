<h2 id="about-the-project">About the Project</h2>
<p>Our aim is to design a two-wheeled balancer, and program a
self-balancing robot that uses LQR control to maintain its upright
position. The project integrates concepts from linear algebra, state
space equations, Lagrangian mechanics, and control theory, along with 3D
modeling, MATLAB simulations, and stepper motor control with
ESP-IDF.</p>
<h2 id="lagrangian-mechanics">Lagrangian Mechanics</h2>
<p>Instead of focusing on forces and Newton’s laws, Lagrangian mechanics
uses the Lagrangian function, <span class="math inline">\({L}\)</span>,
which is the difference between the kinetic energy <span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span> and potential energy <span
class="math inline">\(V\)</span> of a system: <br> <span
class="math display">\[\qquad \qquad L=T-V \]</span></p>
<p>The Lagrangian approach is better because we don’t need to know the
forces but just the constraints and we can straightforwardly use any
type of coordinates we want as long as they describe the system.
Equations of motion are obtained by using <br> <br> <span
class="math display">\[\qquad \qquad \frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial
L}{\partial \dot{q}_i}\right)-\frac{\partial L}{\partial q_i} =0
\]</span></p>
<h2 id="control-system">Control System</h2>
<p>Control means to regulate or direct. Thus, a control system is the
interconnection of various physical elements connected in a way to
regulate or direct itself or the other system. ### State Space System A
system to be controlled is described as <br> <span
class="math display">\[\qquad \qquad\dot{x}=Ax+Bu\]</span> <br></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(x=\)</span> state variables, <span
class="math inline">\(\dot{x}=\)</span> rate of change of state
variables, <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> is the input by
actuator, matrix <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> describes how
the state variables interact and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>
describes how inputs <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> affect the
state. <br> <span class="math display">\[\qquad \qquad y=Cx+Du\]</span>
<br></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is the output vector, <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is a matrix that maps the state
variables to the outputs, and <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>
describes how the inputs directly affect the outputs. <br> This
representation allows us to model and analyze the system.</p>
<h3 id="lqr-control">LQR control</h3>
<p>Now we know how to represent a system to be controlled. LQR stands
for Linear Quadratic Control, as the name suggests it tries to minimize
the quadratic cost function of a linear system. Here, <br> <span
class="math display">\[\qquad \qquad J=\displaystyle \int_{0}^{ \infty }
(x^TQx+u^TRu) dt\]</span> <br> <br> is our cost function. Where, <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> positive matrix that penalizes state
error, and <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> penalizes control
effort. <br> Optimal control effort is obtained by using <span
class="math display">\[u=-Kx\]</span> For that <span
class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is the gain matrix given by <span
class="math inline">\(R^{-1}B^TP\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is solution of Algebraic Riccati
equation <br> <br> <span class="math display">\[\qquad \qquad
A^TP+PA-PBR^{-1}B^TP+Q=0\]</span> <br> <br> Uff, enough maths let’s get
to implementaion.</p>
<h2 id="implementation-in-matlab">Implementation in MATLAB</h2>
<p>Let’s try to model an inverse pendulum on a cart using LQR control
<br> <img src="./FBD2.png" alt="FBD2" /></p>
<p>Using Lagrangian the equations obtained is -&gt; <br> <br> <span
class="math display">\[\qquad \qquad
L=\frac{1}{2}\dot{x}^2(M+m)+\frac{1}{2}m(
l^2\dot{\theta}^2+2l\dot{x}\dot{\theta}cos(\theta) ) \]</span> <br> <br>
Note that these equations are Non-Linear, to linearize them we must
consider an equilibrium point(be it a stable or unstable). Supposing
that point to be when <span class="math inline">\(x=0\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\theta=0\)</span>.<br>By applying Euler Lagrange
equation, <br> <br> <span class="math display">\[\qquad \qquad
\displaylines{ (M+m)\ddot{x}+ml\ddot{\theta}=u \\  l\ddot{\theta} +
\ddot{x}-g\theta=0}\]</span> <br> <br> As a proud engineer, we should
consider approximations such as <span
class="math inline">\(cos\theta\)</span> -&gt;<span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(sin\theta\)</span> -&gt;<span
class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>. <br> Now we can model this system
in MATLAB. For that <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> matrix in
state space equation is our jacobian matrix w.r.t state variables and
<span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> matrix is jacobian matrix w.r.t
actuator variables.</p>
<h4
id="my-state-variables-here-are-x-quad-theta-quad-dotx-quad-dottheta-initial-position-being-x2-rest-are-zero-and-final-position-is-x-2.">My
state variables here are <span class="math inline">\([x \quad
\theta  \quad \dot{x} \quad \dot{\theta}]\)</span> , initial position
being <span class="math inline">\(x=2\)</span> , rest are zero and final
position is <span class="math inline">\(x=-2\)</span>.</h4>
<p>Hence, the cart tries to adjust itself such that it achieves the
final position of x=-2 with balancing the pendulum.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Putting all this in MATLAB and simulating gives us such controlled
output</p>
<p><img src="./inverted.gif" alt="inverted" /> <br></p>
<p>The pendulum achieves a rest state at given position. ### Relation of
<span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> As we saw earlier LQR tries to minimize
the cost function consisting of <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> matrices. #### <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> penalizes state error what does that
mean? Let’s take a base case of a simple pendulum with Q matrix defined
as Q=[100 0; 0 100] and R as 0.001 and we have to achieve an end point
of <span class="math inline">\(-\pi/2\)</span> from rest. <br> For a
pendulum it’s state variables are defined by it’s angle <span
class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\dot{\theta}\)</span> ,Q=[100 0; 0 100] says that
we have given equal penalty to both error in position and velocity(Here
in terms of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>). <br> In
simulation is obtained as <br> <img src="./Base.gif" alt="Base" /></p>
<p><br> #### Now let’s penalize error in position more Q=[100 0; 0 1]
<br></p>
<figure>
<img src="./Q_More.gif" alt="Q_More" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Q_More</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This happens because the control tries to minimize the error in
position faster than velocity</p>
<p><br> #### Let’s penalize actuator effort R=1 <br></p>
<figure>
<img src="./R_More.gif" alt="R_More" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">R_More</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><br> See how the actuator aims to use least amount of effort to
conserve energy. <br></p>

<p>In practical robotics, balancing actuator effort and energy is
crucial to ensure efficiency and performance. Efficient control
conserves energy, which is essential for battery-powered robots and
helps extend their operational time. Such control also helps us setting
the limits of a system.</p>
<h2 id="d-model-and-specifications">3D Model and specifications</h2>
<p>We created a 3D model of our balancer using Onshape. For control we
plan to use NEMA17 stepper motors for precision control along wiht A2988
motor driver. Using ESP32-WROOM we plan to launch our model to control
it.</p>
